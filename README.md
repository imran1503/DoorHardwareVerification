# Project DoorHardwareVV
This is a web application that will allow door hardware technicians to plan proposed door hardware ahead of time in order to confirm compatibility. 

This is managed by having a compatability table and identification tables that are stored on a local MySQL database.
*** Future iterations will have the database stored on a amazon database server.
