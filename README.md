# Project DoorHardwareVV
This is a python application with connections to a MySQL database that will allow door hardware technicians to plan proposed door hardware ahead of time in order to confirm compatibility. 

This is managed by having a compatability table and identification tables that are stored on a local MySQL database.

## Future Goals:
- Database stored on a amazon database server.
- Move from a python script to a web site.
- Implement user account system.
